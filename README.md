# REVERSE_SHELL AND HANDLER 


1) handler.py HANDLES THE CONTROLS OF THE PAYLOAD
2) CORRESPONDING reverse_shell.py SCRIPT
3) DEPENDEDNT AND INCLUDED SCRIPTS - keyLogger.py ; soundRecorder.py

* This set of scripts - the handler; Command and Control Center (C3) along with its reverse shell (and other dependednt utility scripts) allows a basic remote connection to a target machine

* C3.py is the controller - to be deployed on the attacker machine
* reverse_shell.py - "Online_Safety_Guide.png.exe" is the payload (to be injected into the victim machine and needs to be run by the user)

- Once connected, the handler replicates a CLI of the victim machine
- Command Line/ Terminal/ Shell commands can be issued from this handler CLI to be executed in the compromised victim machine

- The handler can also UPLOAD (INJECT FILES FROM ATTACKER MACHINE TO VICTIM)
- or DOWNLOAD (PULL FILES FROM VICTIM TO ATTACKER) files to and from the victim machine
* (relevant commands can be seen by issuing the HELP command)


- Once connected, the attacker gains access to the victim machine and can carry out the following:-
	* Recording audio from Microphone
	* Capturing image/ video from the Default Webcam
	* Log keystrokes (keylogger)
	* Taking a screenshot of the victim's current screen
-> These records can then be sent back to the attacker machine

- To get a full list of possible commands that can be issued, the handler can issue the HELP command
	- Note that this overrides the command line 'help' command available in most systems.

* The complete usage guides are provided in the USAGE GUIDES directory
* PLEASE START WITH READING THE "README_FIRST.txt" FILE AND PROCEED AS INSTRUCTED
* Most of the process has been automated with a self explanatory bash script C3.sh, which takes care of executing the handler code and creating the payload based on a pre-defined rule.
* Once the script confirms that the payload has been created, it can be injected into the victim machine via various Social Engineering techniques.
